### Abstract Class: Person
- `compareTo(Person other)`: Compares this person with another person based on their names.
- `equals(Object o)`: Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.

### Interface: PatientBuilder
- `setPhoneNumber(String phoneNumber)`: Sets the phone number of the patient.
- `setId(String id)`: Sets the ID of the patient.
- `setName(String name)`: Sets the name of the patient.
- `build()`: Constructs and returns the patient object.

### Abstract Class: Marker
- Marker interface indicating that a class is a doctor.

## Design Patterns

### Creation Patterns
1. Factory Method Pattern: `PersonFactory` interface and `DoctorFactory` class implement the factory method pattern for creating doctor objects.
2. Builder Pattern: `PatientBuilder` interface and `PatientBuilderImpl` class implement the builder pattern for constructing patient objects.

### Structural Patterns
1. Marker Interface Pattern: `Marker` interface acts as a marker for classes implementing doctor functionalities.
